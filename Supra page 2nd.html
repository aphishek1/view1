Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in
 the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine,
 in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.</i><h4>

<h4><i>In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing 
middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling 
automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of 
the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by 
revenue, as of December 2020. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million
 vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By 
September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.
Toyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles,
 starting with the introduction of the original Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid 
vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt 
all-electric vehicles, instead focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai,
 a technology that is much costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries in terms of adoption.</i><h4>
